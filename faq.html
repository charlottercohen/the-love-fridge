                    <p>
                        You can drop off food you have acquired yourself or any food you have received as a donation from folks/businesses. If you are wondering what type of donations we are looking for, please read below. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anybody can donate food! You don’t have to be connected to our group or another organization, individual and community donations are always welcome. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When stocking fridges we ask that you put the newest items in the back and the older items near the front so that we are following the first-in-first-out rule. Dating food items is helpful but not necessary as the turnover rate may be pretty fast. However, we do encourage labelling foods that were prepared in a home or by a business with ingredients that were used in case of allergies. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Please help keep the fridges clean when you are stocking. For example if you notice a spill or something spoiling, please take the extra few minutes to clean it up as best as you can or throw out whatever doesn’t seem safe to eat.

                    <h3>i know a business who has food to donate. how do I get them involved?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are looking for businesses such as grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, bodegas, and market stands to donate any unused food on a regular basis. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you have a personal connection with a business who is willing to donate or you are a business owner, you can <a href="mailto: thelovefridgechicago@gmail.com">contact us</a> to set up a regular donation schedule for the community fridge closest to you.

                    <h3>what can I stock the fridge with?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anything from fresh produce, pre-prepared meals, canned goods, non perishable items, fruits and veggies grown in yards and gardens, we will accept. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We are trying to stick with more plant-based foods as we are worried about the food safety of donated meat products, especially uncooked meat. However, we will accept non-plant based staple food items such as milk and eggs as they are always in demand. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you are donating a meal that has been cooked/prepared by a human, please make sure whoever prepared it has strictly followed food safety and cleanliness guidelines, such as using disposable gloves, in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19. We also encourage labelling these meals with the ingredients used to make it so that people with allergies are aware of what’s in them.

                    <h3>i have a car/van/truck, how do I help out with transportation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will always need volunteers with reliable transportation to be willing to stock fridges on a regular basis. If a business wants to donate, you may be asked to go pick up the donated items and deliver them to the fridge. 
                        <br>
                        We are also looking for help from people who drive larger vehicles such as trucks and vans to transport fridges. When we are able to secure a new fridge, we will need someone to come pick it up and then drop it off once we secure a location for the fridge. 
                        <br>

                    <h3>i want to set up a fridge in my neighborhood. How do I get started?</h3>
                    <p>
                        First, read through <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C-kx5R0qZyLQzdiSWAd8w-5WUdUS92_6/view">this pdf</a> of information from our NYC friends on how they set their fridges up and what to consider. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Next, scout out a good home for the fridge. Get in touch with the owner of the business or residence directly and ask for their permission, there is an example script/template for how to ask <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1az-yAApGGj1h2D0lfa2GFTlCmD-muKUloBvqXjMmMgQ/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
                        Things to consider when looking for a location are:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Is there need in this community for free food? Is there already easy access to free food?
                        <br>
                        2. Is there a business or residence that is willing to host the fridge and provide a reliable electricity hookup for the fridge? 
                        <br>
                        3. Will this spot get lots of foot traffic or is it difficult to get to? 
                        <br>
                        4. Will the fridge be blocking a large part of the sidewalk or will there still be plenty of space for pedestrians to walk by? 
                        <br>
                        5. Is the fridge in a location where volunteers can get to it easily to stock it, maintain it, and check up on it? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can contact us <a href="mailto: thelovefridgechicago@gmail.com">via email</a> to get help with acquiring a fridge, connecting with other volunteers in your area, and help transporting the fridge.
