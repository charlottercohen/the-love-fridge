                        You can drop off food you have acquired yourself or any food you have received as a donation from folks/businesses. If you are wondering what type of donations we are looking for, please read below. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anybody can donate food! You don’t have to be connected to our group or another organization, individual and community donations are always welcome. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When stocking fridges we ask that you put the newest items in the back and the older items near the front so that we are following the first-in-first-out rule. Dating food items is helpful but not necessary as the turnover rate may be pretty fast. However, we do encourage labelling foods that were prepared in a home or by a business with ingredients that were used in case of allergies. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Please help keep the fridges clean when you are stocking. For example if you notice a spill or something spoiling, please take the extra few minutes to clean it up as best as you can or throw out whatever doesn’t seem safe to eat.

                    <h3>i know a business who has food to donate. how do I get them involved?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are looking for businesses such as grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, bodegas, and market stands to donate any unused food on a regular basis. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you have a personal connection with a business who is willing to donate or you are a business owner, you can contact us to set up a regular donation schedule for the community fridge closest to you.

                    <h3>what can I stock the fridge with?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anything from fresh produce, pre-prepared meals, canned goods, non perishable items, fruits and veggies grown in yards and gardens, we will accept. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We are trying to stick with more plant-based foods as we are worried about the food safety of donated meat products, especially uncooked meat. However, we will accept non-plant based staple food items such as milk and eggs as they are always in demand. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you are donating a meal that has been cooked/prepared by a human, please make sure whoever prepared it has strictly followed food safety and cleanliness guidelines, such as using disposable gloves, in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19. We also encourage labelling these meals with the ingredients used to make it so that people with allergies are aware of what’s in them.
