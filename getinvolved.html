                    You can drop off food you have acquired yourself or any food you have received as a donation from folks/businesses. If you are wondering what type of donations we are looking for, please read below. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anybody can donate food! You don’t have to be connected to our group or another organization, individual and community donations are always welcome.

                <p>
                    We are looking for businesses such as grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, bodegas, farms, and market stands to donate any unused food on a regular basis. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you have a personal connection with a business who is willing to donate or you are a business owner, you can contact us to set up a regular donation schedule for the community fridge closest to you.

                <h3>What can I stock the fridge with?</h3>
                <p>
                    We accept fresh produce, prepared meals, canned goods, non-perishable items, fruits and veggies grown in yards and gardens, and more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We are trying to stick with more plant-based foods as we are worried about the food safety of donated meat products, especially uncooked meat. However, we will accept non-plant based staple food items such as milk and eggs as they are always in demand. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are donating a meal that has been cooked/prepared by a human, please make sure whoever prepared it has strictly followed food safety and cleanliness guidelines, such as using disposable gloves, in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19. We also encourage labelling these meals with the ingredients used to make it so that people with allergies are aware of what’s in them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If possible, please write the date on your donation so our fridge managers can be aware of how long items sit in the fridge, especially prepared meals or non-vegetarian items.

                <h3>I have a car/van/truck, how do I help out with transportation?</h3>
                <p>
                    We will always need volunteers with reliable transportation to be willing to stock fridges on a regular basis. If a business wants to donate, you may be asked to go pick up the donated items and deliver them to the fridge. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We are also looking for help from people who drive larger vehicles such as trucks and vans to transport fridges. When we are able to secure a new fridge, we will need someone to come pick it up and then drop it off once we secure a location for the fridge.

                <h3>I want to set up a fridge in my neighborhood. How do I get started?</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>First, scout out a home for the fridge. See below for more tips on finding viable locations for community fridges. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, get in touch with the owner of the business or residence directly and ask for their permission. If you would like a template for reaching out to potential hosts, shoot us an email and we can walk you through the process. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you have a host identified, it is time to get your hands on a fridge! We have had our best luck finding fridges by putting out calls to the local community, scouring Facebook groups and marketplace, searching Craiglist, and just asking around in everyday conversations.

                <h3>Things to consider when looking for a location are:</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Is there need in this community for free food? Is there already easy access to free food? 
                    <br>
                    2. Is there a business or residence that is willing to host the fridge and provide a reliable electricity hookup for the fridge? 
                    <br>
                    3. Will this spot get lots of foot traffic or is it difficult to get to? 
                    <br>
                    4. Will the fridge be blocking a large part of the sidewalk or will there still be plenty of space for pedestrians to walk by? 
                    <br>
                    5. Is the fridge in a location where volunteers can get to it easily to stock it, maintain it, and check up on it? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can contact us via email to get help with acquiring a fridge, connecting with other volunteers in your area, and help transporting the fridge.
