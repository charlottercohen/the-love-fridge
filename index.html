            <h1>our mission</h1>
            <p>
                The Love Fridge is a mutual aid network that sets up community-run, free-food fridges across the city of Chicago. Our community refrigerators are hosted by local businesses and supported through a network of more than 50 organizers across Chicago. Our goal is to empower communities, feed people and eliminate food waste.

                <h3>what is mutual aid?</h3>
                <p>Mutual aid is not a form of charity. Mutual aid is a guiding principle for practicing reciprocal and collective care. Mutual aid networks provide a way to meet the basic needs of the community while allowing each other to contribute what we have to the common good. Exchanges like these teach us to value people for their talents and the things we share, instead of seeing each other as only bosses, employees, or consumers.</p>

                <p>There's a bunch of different ways to get involved. Have a fridge that you don't need anymore? Donate it. Have an accessible location that could be home to a beautiful community fridge? Host one. Want to help keep the fridges fully stocked and clean? Volunteer.</p>
