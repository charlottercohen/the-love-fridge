            <p>
                <b>The Love Fridge</b> is a collective that practices mutual aid grounded in food. We are powered by kindness, generosity, and most importantly, <b>love</b>. We are your neighbors, looking out for our community. We have the common belief that being able to feed yourself is not a privilege, but a right. With food insecurity at an all-time high, keeping our communities fed right now is more important than ever. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Our goal as a collective is to nourish our communities while combating food scarcity and food waste. Our volunteers often live in the communities in which they contribute and coordinate with local, like-minded businesses to place community refrigerators. These refrigerators, painted by local artists to reflect the communities in which they live, provide people with access to donate and/or take food with a goal of providing access 24/7 where possible.

                <h3>what is mutual aid?</h3>
                <p>Mutual aid is not a form of charity, but a guiding principle for practicing reciprocal and collective care. Mutual aid networks provide a way to meet the basic needs of the community while allowing each other to contribute what we can to the common good. Put simply, we look out for one another in any way that we are able to. </p>
