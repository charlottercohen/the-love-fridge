            <h1>our mission</h1>
            <p>
                We at The Love Fridge Chicago have a common belief, that feeding yourself is not a privilege, but a right. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven food insecurity to an all-time high and keeping our communities fed right now is more important than ever. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Our goal as a collective, is to organize volunteers and help place community refrigerators throughout the city of Chicago. These refrigerators, painted by local artists to reflect the communities in which they live, provide folks with access to donate and/or take food 24/7.
            </p>

                <h3>what is mutual aid?</h3>
                <p>Mutual aid is not a form of charity, but a guiding principle for practicing reciprocal and collective care. Mutual aid networks provide a way to meet the basic needs of the community while allowing each other to contribute what we have to the common good. Exchanges like these teach us to value people for their talents and the things we share, instead of seeing each other as only bosses, employees, or consumers.</p>
